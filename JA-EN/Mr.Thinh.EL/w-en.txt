thank you, this simpler solution worked for me. I have a picture box which is filled inside the panel. Instead of panel mouse enter. i did picturebox mouse enter which resolved my issue
This can create a very unexpected behavior, if you click into a textBox or want to edit something else this will focus the panel if you hover into it. I would not do this.. (just my opinion

Make sure that your panel has focus. And this is simple code to scroll your panel scrollbar. Hope this help. ) enter code here
